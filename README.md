# Ares - Light Effects Fork

Ares (Aural RPG Experience System) is a software to play music and sounds during (pen & paper) role-playing games. You define which music and / or sounds to play when a certain situation occurs in an Editor program. Then, during the game, they are played by a Player program or app and you control which ones to play with a Controller program or app.

This fork is used to implement light effects remote control via Jinx! [http://www.live-leds.de/].

You can find out more about Ares on its homepage at http://aresrpg.sourceforge.net/. There you can also download pre-built executables. This site on GitHub is mainly for developers which are interested in the source code and may even wish to contribute to the development of Ares.
